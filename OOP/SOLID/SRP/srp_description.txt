SRP (Single Responsability Principle)

Being the 1st principle of SOLID, The Single Responsability Principle states that a class that a class should have only one well-defined responsibility. 
In other words, a class should be responsible for only one task or one aspect of the system.

Examples:

Bad Example 
class User:
    def create_user(self, username, password, email):
        print("registered user in db")
    def send_email(self, subject, to_email):
        print("email sent")
    def log_error(self, error):
        print("log:", error)
    def register_user(self, username, password, email):
        try:
            self.create_user(username, password, email)
            self.send_email("user registered", email)
        except Exception:
            self.log_error("error in user register")

user = User()
user.register_user("anji", "secret", "anji@example.com")

In the class User, we can see it has a total of 4 responsibilities: the register_user, login_user, send_email and log_error. Therefore violating the SRP principle.


Good Example
class UserDB:
    def create_user(self, username, password, email):
        print("registered user in db")

class Email:
    def send_email(self, subject, to_email):
        print("email sent")

class ErrorLog:
    def log_error(self, error):
        print("log:", error)

class User:
    def register_user(self, username, password, email):
        try:
            user_db = UserDB()
            user_db.create_user(username, password, email)
            email_server = Email()
            email_server.send_email("user registered", email)
        except Exception:
            logger = ErrorLog()
            logger.log_error("error in user register")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    user = User()
    user.register_user("anji", "secret", "anji@example.com")

By implementing the Single Responsibility Principle we can see that the code more readable and maintainable now, due to each class implementing their specific method.
Let's say if want to add a new feature to update_user which updates the user info to the database. We can simply add the method to UserDB class. Because, it's related to database.
